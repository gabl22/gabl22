### Hey ho! ðŸš€
I'm gabl, level 15 in life and Austrian.
In my free time, I'll develop mainly in Java.

  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m mainly working alone (sadly :c)<br>
  If I am not working, i am sleeping or eating<br>
  each with a probability of .5<br>

  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently ("still") learning about Java<br>
  Whenever a day passes, I've learned something new.<br>
  I've dedicated some time to HTML, JS and CSS,<br>
  but I'm honest - It was awful. I really do not like<br>
  frontend development. <b>Praise to Frontend Devs</b>ðŸŽ‰<br>
  I've little experience with Python. (Stay tuned!) 
  
  âœ¨ You're asking about my story?<br>
  My story is not finished yet.<br>
  I'm still writing...<br>
  working...<br>
  Go on.<br>
  Wake up.
  
  To be continued.
  
  talKie, gabl

  Wait. What even is a talKie?
  
  My answer is maybe. Just maybe.
