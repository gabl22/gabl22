### Hey ho! ðŸš€
I'm gabl, level 14 in life and Austrian.
In my free time, I'll develop mainly in Java.

  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m mainly working on [NatroxMC](https://github.com/NatroxMC/)<br>
  Meanwhile, I work on other projects, mostly private,<br>
  but you can visit [XML](https://github.com/gabl22/XML), an XML Parser.

  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Java<br>
  Whenever a day passes, I've learned something new.<br>
  I've dedicated some time to HTML, JS and CSS,<br>
  but I'm honest - It was awful. I really do not like<br>
  frontend development. <b>Praise to Frontend Devs</b>ðŸŽ‰<br>
  I've little experience with Python. At the moment,<br>
  I'm interested in DOS systems, playing around<br>
  with Microsoft Batch & PowerShell as well as<br>
  other libraries in Java. (Stay tuned!) 
  
  âœ¨ You're asking about my story?<br>
  My story is not finished yet.<br>
  I'm still writing...<br>
  working...<br>
  Go on.<br>
  Wake up.
  
  To be continued.
  
  talKie, gabl
